                        He developed polypropylene pumps and was moving forward with a vision of developing lined pumps. Sadly in 1999 after his demise, his brothers Mr. MSER, Mr EER & Mr AER carry forwarded the same vision and continued with the development of lined pumps. Slowly and steadily with the best quality, Leak Proof Pumps attained top spot in the market for non-metallic pumps. Today with the same vision and continuous development Mr MSER and his sons are pushing the organization to achieve our founders dream.
